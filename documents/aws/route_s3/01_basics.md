# üìò What is DNS?

**DNS (Domain Name System)** is essentially the **‚Äúphonebook of the internet.‚Äù** It translates **human-friendly domain names** like `www.google.com` into **IP addresses** like `142.250.182.132` that computers use to identify each other on the network.

Without DNS, users would need to remember IP addresses to visit websites.

## üß† Technical Understanding of How DNS Works

When you type a domain (e.g., `example.com`) into your browser, here‚Äôs a **step-by-step breakdown** of what happens:

---

### üîÅ 1. **DNS Resolution (Name Resolution Process)**

#### Step-by-Step Query Flow:

1. **Browser Cache**

   - The browser checks if it has recently resolved the domain.
   - If yes, it uses that IP and skips DNS resolution.

2. **OS Cache**

   - If the browser doesn‚Äôt have it, it asks the operating system (OS) resolver.
   - The OS checks its local DNS cache.

3. **Hosts File**

   - The OS checks `/etc/hosts` (Linux/Mac) or `C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts` (Windows).

4. **DNS Resolver (Recursive Resolver)**

   - If not found locally, the OS sends a query to the **configured DNS resolver**, typically provided by your ISP or set to public ones like **Google (8.8.8.8)** or **Cloudflare (1.1.1.1)**.

---

### üìç 2. **Recursive Resolution Process by the Resolver**

If the resolver has no cached result, it performs these steps:

1. **Query Root Name Server**

   - The root server responds with a referral to a **TLD server** (e.g., `.com`).

2. **Query TLD Name Server**

   - The `.com` server responds with the **authoritative name server** for `example.com`.

3. **Query Authoritative Name Server**

   - The authoritative name server replies with the **actual IP address** (e.g., `93.184.216.34`).

---

### üîÑ 3. **Return Path**

The resolver:

- Returns the IP address to your OS.
- The OS gives it to your browser.
- The browser initiates an HTTP/HTTPS connection using the IP.

All of this usually happens in **milliseconds.**

## üìÇ Types of DNS Servers

| Server Type              | Description                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Recursive Resolver**   | Handles full query process on behalf of client (e.g., Google DNS). |
| **Root Name Server**     | Directs resolver to TLD server (13 root servers globally).         |
| **TLD Name Server**      | Points to authoritative servers (e.g., `.com`, `.org`).            |
| **Authoritative Server** | Holds actual DNS records (A, CNAME, MX, etc.).                     |

---

## üßæ Common DNS Record Types

| Record Type | Description                      |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| **A**       | Maps domain to IPv4 address.     |
| **AAAA**    | Maps domain to IPv6 address.     |
| **CNAME**   | Alias of another domain.         |
| **MX**      | Mail server records.             |
| **NS**      | Lists authoritative DNS servers. |
| **TXT**     | Text records for SPF, DKIM, etc. |
| **PTR**     | Reverse DNS (IP to hostname).    |

## ‚öôÔ∏è DNS Caching & TTL

- **DNS responses are cached** at multiple levels (browser, OS, resolver) to reduce load.
- Each record has a **TTL (Time to Live)** value that controls how long it should be cached.

---

## üîê DNS Security Concepts

- **DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions):** Adds cryptographic signatures to DNS responses to prevent tampering (spoofing).
- **DoH (DNS over HTTPS):** Encrypts DNS queries to protect privacy.
- **DoT (DNS over TLS):** Alternative encrypted DNS method.

## üõ†Ô∏è CLI Tools to Inspect DNS

### üîç Linux/macOS

```bash
dig example.com
nslookup example.com
host example.com
```

### ü™ü Windows

```cmd
nslookup example.com
```

## üìö Use Cases & Real-World Implications

- **Load balancing:** via round-robin A records or geo-DNS.
- **CDN integration:** DNS-based routing to nearest server.
- **Email delivery:** via MX records.
- **Domain verification:** with TXT records for SPF/DKIM.
- **Subdomain delegation:** with NS records.
