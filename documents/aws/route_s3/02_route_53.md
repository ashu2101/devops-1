# AWS Route 53 In-Depth Guide

**Amazon Route 53** is a highly available and scalable cloud DNS (Domain Name System) web service designed to give developers and businesses a reliable way to route end users to internet applications. It also enables domain registration, health checks, and DNS management.

---

## üìå Core Features of Route 53

1. **Domain Registration**: Buy and manage domain names.
2. **DNS Service**: Manage DNS records for domain names.
3. **Health Checking**: Monitor endpoints and route traffic accordingly.
4. **Traffic Flow**: Manage complex traffic routing policies like failover, geo, latency-based routing.

## üåç Public vs Private Hosted Zones

### üîπ Public Hosted Zone

- **Used for publicly accessible domain names.**
- Example: `mywebsite.com` accessible over the internet.
- Responds to DNS queries from **any client** over the public internet.
- Use case: Hosting a website or API that needs to be accessible globally.

### üîí Private Hosted Zone

- **Used for internal domain names** within one or more VPCs.
- Example: `internal.mycompany.com` used for internal apps.
- Responds to DNS queries **only from inside the associated VPC(s)**.
- Use case: Microservices communication in a private network, private services, or internal databases.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Create a Hosted Zone in Route 53

### ‚úÖ Public Hosted Zone

1. Go to **Route 53 Console** > **Hosted zones**.
2. Click **Create hosted zone**.
3. Provide:

   - **Domain Name**: `example.com`
   - **Type**: Public Hosted Zone
   - **Comment (optional)**

4. Click **Create hosted zone**.

‚û°Ô∏è Route 53 automatically creates:

- **NS (Name Server)** record
- **SOA (Start of Authority)** record

### ‚úÖ Private Hosted Zone

1. Go to **Route 53 Console** > **Hosted zones**.
2. Click **Create hosted zone**.
3. Provide:

   - **Domain Name**: `internal.example.com`
   - **Type**: Private Hosted Zone
   - **VPC ID**: Select one or more VPCs to associate

4. Click **Create hosted zone**

## üìÑ DNS Record Types in Route 53

| Record Type | Description                         |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| A           | Maps domain to IPv4 address         |
| AAAA        | Maps domain to IPv6 address         |
| CNAME       | Alias of another domain             |
| MX          | Mail exchange                       |
| TXT         | Text data (used for SPF/DKIM/etc.)  |
| NS          | Delegates DNS zone to other servers |
| PTR         | Reverse DNS mapping                 |
| SRV         | Specifies ports and priorities      |
| Alias       | AWS-specific: maps to AWS resources |

## üåê Buying a Domain Name via Route 53

### Step-by-Step:

1. Go to **Route 53 Console** > **Domains** > **Registered domains**.
2. Click **Register domain**.
3. Search for the desired domain (e.g., `ashutechlabs.com`).
4. Select the domain if available.
5. Fill in:

   - Contact info (admin, registrant, tech)
   - Duration of registration (1-10 years)

6. Choose **auto-renew** (recommended).
7. Accept the terms and proceed with payment.

### Notes:

- You get a free public hosted zone created automatically.
- Domain propagation may take a few minutes to several hours.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Routing Policies

| Policy Type        | Use Case                                           |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Simple             | Single record, static value                        |
| Weighted           | Split traffic across resources based on weight     |
| Latency-based      | Route to region with lowest latency                |
| Failover           | Route to healthy resource (active-passive setup)   |
| Geolocation        | Route based on the user's location                 |
| Multi-value Answer | Return multiple healthy records (like round-robin) |

## üîê Security & Best Practices

- Use **Alias records** for AWS resources (like CloudFront, ELB) instead of CNAME.
- For **private hosted zones**, associate them with multiple VPCs using AWS CLI.
- Implement **DNSSEC** for domain name protection (currently only for domain registration).
- Avoid exposing sensitive internal DNS via public hosted zones.

## üõ†Ô∏è Route 53 CLI Commands (Examples)

### Create Hosted Zone

```bash
aws route53 create-hosted-zone \
  --name example.com \
  --caller-reference $(date +%s) \
  --hosted-zone-config Comment="My hosted zone",PrivateZone=false
```

### List Hosted Zones

```bash
aws route53 list-hosted-zones
```

### Create Record Set (A Record)

```bash
aws route53 change-resource-record-sets \
  --hosted-zone-id ZONEID123 \
  --change-batch '{
    "Changes": [{
      "Action": "UPSERT",
      "ResourceRecordSet": {
        "Name": "test.example.com",
        "Type": "A",
        "TTL": 300,
        "ResourceRecords": [{"Value": "192.0.2.1"}]
      }
    }]
  }'
```
